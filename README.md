# 👋 Hey there, I'm Victor

Welcome to my digital playground — where bioinformatics, AI, and full-stack wizardry collide. I work at the intersection of machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and web development, with a healthy dose of passion for automation, open-source, and all things Linux.

## 🧙 About Me

- 🧠 Fascinated by how biology and AI can merge to solve real problems  
- 👾 Builder of bots, breaker of bugs, fan of open-source  
- 🧑‍💻 I like things that work fast, look clean, and solve real problems

- ## 🔧 Server Ops

- Running multiple **GPU containers** on a Threadripper Pro system  
- Managing **Nextcloud**, **Ollama**, **Samba shares**, and **Home Assistant**  
- Reverse proxies via Docker and Nginx for secure, remote access  
- Heavy use of **MergerFS** and **SSD pools** for efficient storage

## 🔬 Current Projects

- **Protein Structure Annotation Platform**  
  Building a web-based system to **upload, visualize, and annotate PDB files** using swipe-based gestures. Features include auto-rotation 3D viewers, annotation tracking, and CSV export.
-  **Local LLM Serving**  
  Running **vLLM**, **Open WebUI**, and **Ollama** to serve large language models like **LLaMA 3**, **Gemma**, and **GGUF** variants across multiple GPUs via Docker.
-  **Tail Fiber / DPO ML Pipelines**  
  Repurposing an ML pipeline from depolymerases (DPOs) to tail fibers — leveraging **domain-based filtering** and **curated NCBI datasets** for functional prediction.
