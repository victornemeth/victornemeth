# 👋 Hey there, I'm Victor

Welcome to my digital playground — where bioinformatics, AI, and full-stack wizardry collide. I’m passionate about shaping the future where intelligent systems, distributed infrastructure, and intuitive web experiences come together — grounded in automation and open-source principles, running on Linux.

- 🧑‍💻 I like things that work fast, look clean, and solve real problems

- ## 🔧 Server Ops

- Running multiple **GPU containers** on a Threadripper Pro system  
- Reverse proxies via Docker and Nginx for secure, remote access
