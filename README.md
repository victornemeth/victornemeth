# 👋 Hey there, I'm Victor

Welcome to my digital playground — where bioinformatics, AI, and full-stack wizardry collide. I work at the intersection of machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and web development, with a healthy dose of passion for automation, open-source, and all things Linux.

## 🧙 About Me

- 🧠 Fascinated by how biology and AI can merge to solve real problems  
- 👾 Builder of bots, breaker of bugs, fan of open-source  
- 🧑‍💻 I like things that work fast, look clean, and solve real problems

- ## 🔧 Server Ops

- Running multiple **GPU containers** on a Threadripper Pro system  
- Reverse proxies via Docker and Nginx for secure, remote access  

## 🔬 Current Projects

- **Tail Fiber / Tailspike detection tools**
  Building tools to classify domains and proteins, focussing on receptor binding proteins.
- **Evo2 Docker and Apptainer support**  
  Adding docker and apptainer/Singularity support for Evo2
- **Protein Structure Annotation Platform**  
  Building a web-based system to **upload, visualize, and annotate PDB files** using swipe-based gestures. Features include auto-rotation 3D viewers, annotation tracking, and CSV export.
