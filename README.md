# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Victor

Welcome to my digital playground â€” where bioinformatics, AI, and full-stack wizardry collide. Iâ€™m passionate about shaping the future where intelligent systems, distributed infrastructure, and intuitive web experiences come together â€” grounded in automation and open-source principles, running on Linux.

## ðŸ”¬ Current Projects
- **PhaRBP a Phage Receptor Binding Protein Database**
  Currently constructing a phage RBP database that is a collection of different sources, mainly UniProt and Genbank scanned by different TSP and TF classifiers and be filtered and used by everyone.
- **Tail Fiber / Tailspike detection tools**  
  Building tools to classify domains and proteins, focussing on receptor binding proteins, currently experimenting with EVO2 for this task.
- **Protein Structure Annotation Platform**  
  Building a web-based system to **upload, visualize, and annotate PDB files** using swipe-based gestures. Features include auto-rotation 3D viewers, annotation tracking, and CSV export.
